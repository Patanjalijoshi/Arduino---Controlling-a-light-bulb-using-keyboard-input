# Arduino---Controlling-a-light-bulb-using-keyboard-input
This project deals with controlling a light bulb with keyboard input using a relay

## Controlling-a-light-bulb-using-keyboard-input
In this project the serial monitor is used to send messages to the arduino mega 2560 to toggle a lightbulb on and off. The lightbulbs operationg voltage is 220 volts so a relay is used to controll it.



### Components used:
* Arduino Mega 2560 (The code will be compatable with the Arduino uno as well)
* Light bulb 
* Single channel relay

### Code details:
The code is written in C and the Arduino IDE is used to compile and write code on to the Arduino Mega 2560
